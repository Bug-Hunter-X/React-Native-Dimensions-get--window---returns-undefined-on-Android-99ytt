This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` initially, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes in components that depend on these values.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
// ... use width and height ...
```

This is because the dimensions might not be available immediately when the component mounts.  Trying to access them before they're ready results in the error.
